# AI-Driven App Architect

> As AI transforms the coding process, we focus on orchestrating systems and integrating diverse components to deliver innovative solutions at unprecedented speeds.

## Features

- AI-powered development using Cursor and Wispr
- Rapid MVP creation (10x faster than traditional methods)
- Modular project architecture
- Integration of cutting-edge APIs, SDKs, and open-source solutions

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- Supabase
- Flux AI (via Replicate API)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Key Components

- **Cursor Integration**: Intelligent code suggestions and real-time previews
- **Wispr Flow**: Effortless voice dictation for rapid development
- **Supabase Backend**: User authentication and data storage
- **Flux AI Model**: Image processing and AI model training

## FLUX

To fine-tune the **FLUX Pro** model on Replicate, you can follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
1. A **Replicate** account.
2. Training images (around 12-20 for best results).
3. A few dollars for running the model (approximately $2 for a full run).

### Fine-Tuning Steps:
1. **Gather Training Data**: 
   - You’ll need a collection of high-quality images (JPG or PNG) representing the concept you want to teach the model. Ensure variety in settings, poses, and lighting to cover different aspects of the subject. 
   - Optionally, you can create captions in a `.txt` file for each image, but it’s not mandatory.

2. **Prepare a Zip File**:
   - Once you have the images, zip them up. This zip file will be uploaded to Replicate for fine-tuning.

3. **Use a Unique Trigger Word**:
   - Choose a unique **trigger word** to activate your specific fine-tuning. This is the term you’ll use in prompts to activate the fine-tuned model (e.g., “MY_TRIGGER”).
   - Avoid common words to prevent clashes with other models.

4. **Start the Fine-Tuning Process**:
   - On Replicate, navigate to the [FLUX.1 fine-tuning page](https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-flux).
   - Upload your zip file and fill in the required parameters (e.g., the number of training steps, trigger word, etc.). 
   - For most use cases, leave the defaults for learning rate and other advanced settings.

5. **Monitor Training**:
   - The process usually takes about 20 minutes for 1000 steps and 10 images. You can use Replicate’s web interface or programmatically through the API to track the training progress.

6. **Generate Images**:
   - Once training is complete, you can generate images via the web or through an API. In your prompt, be sure to include the trigger word to use your fine-tuned concept.

7. **Optional: API Integration**:
   - You can integrate the trained model into your app using the Replicate API. The API provides flexibility, allowing you to run and tweak your model programmatically in languages like Python and JavaScript.

With these steps, you’ll be able to fine-tune and customize the **FLUX Pro** model to generate specific images based on the training data you’ve provided.
